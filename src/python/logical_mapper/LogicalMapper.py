"""
The logical mapper receives messages from the physical_timeseries queue
and determines which logical device they should be sent to.

If no logical device is mapped to the physical device, a new logical device
is created.

The message has the logical device id added to it and published to the
logical_timeseries queue where it can be picked up by delivery services.

It is up to the delivery services to decide what to do when they receive
a message for a newly created logical device.

For example, delivery services for IoT platforms such as ThingsBoard or
Ubidots should create corresponding devices in those services and add
information to the logical device properties object allowing the logical
device to be associated with the IoT platform device.
