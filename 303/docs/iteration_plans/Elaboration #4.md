# **6.  Assessment**
- ## **Assessment against objectives**
This iteration would be considered successful, as all work items have been completed by LCAM due date.
- ## **Work Items: Planned compared to actually completed**
All work items were completed, with no new issues created for the next iteration.

- **Assessment against Evaluation Criteria Test results**

All documents have been approved by all members, uploaded to repo and to wiki.

All LCAM goals have been met.

We all provided part of the video for executable architecture, while Rishabh also compiled it.

The Trello board was utilised to allow the team to understand if a document is ready for review, and if its been reviewed. This worked well throughout the iteration for tracking progress.

All tasks have been performed in an attempt to adhere to the requirements for a HD within the rubric.
- ## **Other concerns and deviations**
Questions were raised regarding another one of our requirements. This is something being decided by DPI at this time, and is out of our hands. This currently still exists within our documentation. Not considered an issue as it is to be implemented late into the construction phase.

Many things were left until the last minute, so time management could have been better, this will need to be improved for the construction phase as fixing coding/technical issues can take significantly longer than simply writing tests, approving and updating documentation.
