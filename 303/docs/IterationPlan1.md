# **Assessment against objectives**
[Document whether you addressed the objectives as specified in the Iteration Plan.]
- ## **Work Items: Planned compared to actually completed**
[Summarize whether all Work Items planned to be addressed in the iteration were addressed, and which Work Items were postponed or added.]
- ## **Assessment against Evaluation Criteria Test results**
[Document whether you met the evaluation criteria as specified in the Iteration Plan. This could include information such as “Demo for Department X was well-received, with some concerns raised around usability,” or “495 test cases were automated with a 98% pass rate. 9 test cases were deferred because the corresponding Work Items were postponed.”

The most important guideline here is that although satisfactorily completed items may summarily mentioned, incomplete items require a more comprehensive explanation ]
- ## **Other concerns and deviations**
[List other areas that have been evaluated, such as financials, or schedule deviation, as well as Stakeholder feedback not captured elsewhere.]
