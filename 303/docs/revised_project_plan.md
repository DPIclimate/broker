### Project plan

##### 1. Introduction

This Project Plan details the major tasks that are to be accomplished within the one year of the DPI: IoTa Time Series Project. This covers the four phases of the project, which include: the Inception phase, the Elaboration phase, the Construction phase and the Transition phase.

The Inception phase established timelines for important initial phase documents to be completed and knowledge to be gathered.

The Elaboration phase focuses on mitigating risks identified with the project, and to begin development of the project in a testing capacity. Since our project involves the deployment of a time series database, the majority of the elaboration phase will be spent on testing 4 separate open-source time series database offerings. This is conducted to establish development protocols and familiarity with all relevant solutions, and to present our findings with our sponsors.

##### 2. Project organisation

The project team consists of four members: Callum, Rishabh, Sara and Zak. 

Each team member has been assigned a different time series database to implement and evaluate throughout the elaboration iterations, which they will lead testing of during construction iterations. 

A separate CSU team is also working with the Digital Agriculture team’s DPI projects. In a combined sponsor meeting, collaboration between the teams was proposed by the project sponsors. A meeting between the two teams will be required to ensure our work with time series databases will work not only with the current Docker compose stack, but also with the other team’s project of replacing the Docker compose stack with a Kubernetes set up.

##### 3. Project practices and measurements 

The overarching technical development strategy to be used over the course of this project is iterative development. As mentioned previously, this takes the form of 13 2-week iterations split across 4 phases, all focusing on progressive stages of the project. 

Progress in each iteration will be tracked against an official iteration plan document which is collectively made by the group at the start of the iteration. The goals of each iteration are to be dictated roughly by this document, which will cover the major goals for the lifetime of the project.

##### 4. Deployment

As the substantive project is the deployment of a new time series database solution in the backend of the existing IoTa project, the deployment will be carried out across several stages to ensure that the solution eventually chosen fulfills all the needs of the DPI team as far as features, compatibility and self-governance is concerned.

For this reason, during the elaboration and construction phases, the team will individually test and deploy 4 different time series database solutions. The solutions themselves have different feature sets, database functional modalities and compatibilities: the team will aim to find the balance of solutions which will suit the needs of the DPI team for all the mentioned.
