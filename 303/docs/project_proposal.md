# Project List

#### Preference Project
|Preference|Project|Reason we like it|
|--|--|--|
| 1 | #2: DPI: IoTa Time Series Database | Well laid out and detailed listing, it includes database, containers, python and use of a popular message broker (rabbitmq). Quite a few functional and nonfunctional requirements that will make it an engaging and challenging experience. |
| 2 | #8: Building un-hackable DB | Multiple members have interests in either security and/or databases. This project appears very fun and challenging. There are many functional requirements we can add in whilst ensuring the non functional ones are met. |
| 3 | #10: Blockchain/Rust | Interesting topic that will be engaging and challenging. Will give us the chance to gain good experience in Rust. This also can be applied in many areas so we again would have some ‘free will’|
| 4 | #Ours: Interactive Card App | It could be fun and challenging to create. It has many functional and nonfunctional requirements to be met ensuring a good overall learning experience with the subject. |

### Project proposal: (chosen app) P2 IOTA DATABASE


##### About:
At this stage we do not have further information from the interactive site as our planned meeting with the running supervisors has not occured yet (planned ~17.3), however this app is to extend or add functionality to an existing system. Some of the functional and non functional requirements are extract data from messages, write them to both postgres and time series databases, include an API, work within a given container, work with RabbitMQ and use python to implement the codebase

#### Project proposal: Interactive Card App


##### Idea: 
Creating an interactive card webapp, where a user can use templates or create their own to make a simple animated one page site. An example heavily based off some codepen code: https://cufffs.cc/exampled.html 


##### Uses:
Could replace physical cards with cooler virtual ones (i.e. birthday cards, xmas cards),
Could be used for promotions, i.e. sending a link with invitations, or competitions etc
Could be used to give gift cards (given correct security measures)


##### Challenges:
* Requires a well thought out front end for ease of use in adding/changing templates to get a desired look.
* Customizability of existing templates in colour, location, sizing etc.
* Requires ability to run custom written code, and combine several shaders/ideas into a single page.
* Requires ability to generate links for users, ideally with optional password protection and ability to ‘design’ own link i.e www.cards.com/HappyBirthdayGeoff
* Mixes several ideas and languages
* Possibly extra functional features like auto deletion.
* Can add security like encryption for user messages so gift cards etc would be stored safely
* Ability to extract the code or maybe widget so that it can be easily run on someone else's domain (ie promotions)
* Ensuring responsive pages for both pc and phone

##### Benefits:
* Mixes several technologies and can be created in a variety of ways
* Real world use cases
* Many functional and nonfunctional requirements
* Complex and challenging yet (probably) doable
