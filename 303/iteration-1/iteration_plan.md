# 5. Issues

| **Issue** | **Status** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Risk list granularity needs improvement in next iteration of the document | Incomplete | Risk list only contains broad strokes of project risks due to lack of overall detail from the system, the next iteration should address individual risks at a finer detail |
| Risk list contingency plans are vague | Incomplete | Next iteration of risk list needs more fine tuned contingency plans, currently we lack enough information to choose a best contingency plan |
| "Requirement Model - System Interfaces" section may need to expanded based on scope | Incomplete | The section has subsections related to UI elements which at this point in time, do not relate to this project. If the scope widens this can be revisited. |

# 6. Assessment

Overall assessment items were completed as expected, being the initial inception of the documents there is room for improvement that will happen a little in iteration #2 as per the issues from above, however more so in the revised documents coming up in the next assignment.

The biggest challenge this iteration was gaining a solid understanding of the project, and we feel that as the iteration concluded we definitely learned a lot about the project (some questions still to be raised/confirmed with Ben, however we have created a draft for this).

We did some experimentation with iteration #1, by originally assigning whole documents to each person at inception however we then added trello for live updates/dynamic assignment of tasks to help even up the workload. Unfortunately we did not take advantage of this as a team and this has been discussed and we're all actively going to use trello as a key way to keep track and take tasks.

It could be argued that we lost some time by not being active in our communication, and so we're aiming to be more proactive in updating the team and keeping up communication, one way to improve this is not only to use Trello but to link it with our discord (todo: this week) and push feeds a little easier.

The other key aspect that we're changing for iteration #2 is that we've assigned a document master for each document/task who'll be in charge of that document, however the internals will be on trello for people to take and that way each person can contribute to each document some amount to ensure we're all learning equally - this is to address the probable biggest downfall of iteration #1 being that documents were not really added to drive or divided up and so people did not really have the chance to look at each other's document until the end of iteration (which led to a lot of learning!)

As a team, our mindset has moved from 'assignment' style thinking, to 'project' style thinking which frees up our ability to work as a team on a project achieving goals.
