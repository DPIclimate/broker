## **5. Issues**

| **Issue** | **Status** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [1] Risk list granularity needs improvement in next iteration of the document | Incomplete | Risk list only contains broad strokes of project risks due to lack of overall detail from the system, the next iteration should address individual risks at a finer detail |
| [2] Risk list contingency plans are vague | Incomplete | Next iteration of risk list needs more fine tuned contingency plans, currently we lack enough information to choose a best contingency plan |
| [3] "Requirement Model - System Interfaces" section may need to expanded based on scope | Incomplete | The section has subsections related to UI elements which at this point in time, do not relate to this project. If the scope widens this can be revisited. |

## **6. Assessment**

[Use this section for capturing and communicating results and actions from assessments, which are typically done at the end of each iteration. If you don't do this, the team may not be able to improve the way they develop software.]

## **Assessment against objectives**

[Document whether you addressed the objectives as specified in the Iteration Plan.]


## **Work Items: Planned compared to actually completed**

[Summarize whether all Work Items planned to be addressed in the iteration were addressed, and which Work Items were postponed or added.]

## **Assessment against Evaluation Criteria Test results**

[Document whether you met the evaluation criteria as specified in the Iteration Plan. This could include information such as "Demo for Department X was well-received, with some concerns raised around usability," or "495 test cases were automated with a 98% pass rate. 9 test cases were deferred because the corresponding Work Items were postponed."

The most important guideline here is that although satisfactorily completed items may summarily mentioned, incomplete items require a more comprehensive explanation ]


## **Other concerns and deviations**

[List other areas that have been evaluated, such as financials, or schedule deviation, as well as Stakeholder feedback not captured elsewhere.]
