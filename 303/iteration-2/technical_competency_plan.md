## Technical Competency Plan

***<u>Document Summary</u>***

This document exists to summarise how Team 3 will show competency.

The goal of this plan is to be able to show competency through a simple program verified by a set of tests.

We will target a few key use cases to implement in a proof of concept style program.

***<u>Target Platform & Key Technologies</u>***

To show competency for the project we must mirror the project technology stack.

The below table will highlight what technologies we'll be using.

|--|--|
|--|--|
|Environment|Linux|
|Container|Docker, Docker Compose|
|Language|Python, Bash|
|Testing|pytest|
|Database|A TSDB|
|Version Control|git|

***<u>Key Notes</u>***
- The docker containers used will not be identical to the project, they will be basic implementation to show that docker can be used.
- The TSDB we use for proof of competency may not be the TSDB that we will ultimately choose, however we will be evaluating multiple TSDB's in the later stages of the project.
- The program will not be fluid, it will be designed to complete the tests that will evaluate if the key use cases chosen to show competency have succeeded.
