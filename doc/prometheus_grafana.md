# Prometheus

Prometheus gathers and serves metrics for each microservice over a client HTTP server which is retrieved from a
Prometheus server.

The Prometheus client has been added to the Python `requirements.txt` file at `broker/images/restapi/requirements.txt`
and implemented through `npm install prom-client` at `broker/images/ttn_decoder/Dockerfile` which will enable the import
of the client on each of the Python and Node.js microservices.

The Prometheus server has been added to `broker/compose/docker-compose.yml` and is running on and can be accessed from
port `9090`.

## Microservices

Listed below is each microservice that runs a Prometheus client and what metrics it serves.
The Python microservices are served on port `8000` and the `ttn_decoder is served on port `3001`.
Each metric is a counter that increments or decrements in various functions within the microservice.

  phase.

- `logical_mapper_starts_counter` = monitors the number of times the Logical Mapper script has been started.
- `logical_mapper_exits_counter` = tracks the number of times the Logical Mapper script has exited or terminated.

### delivery

# Grafana and Nginx

The Nginx server directs traffic to Grafana as stated in `broker/config/nginx.conf`.

## Accessing the Services

- Grafana can be accessed at http://localhost:3000. Use the username `admin` and password `password` to log in
- Nginx can be accessed at http://localhost or https://localhost which will redirect to Grafana.
